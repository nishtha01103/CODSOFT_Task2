Personal Portfolio Website 
I have designed and developed a comprehensive personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey.

🛠 Features:

	1.	About Me: A detailed section highlighting my background, skills, and interests.
	2.	Projects: A portfolio of my key projects, including descriptions, technologies used, and links to live demos or repositories.
	3.	Resume: An easily accessible and downloadable resume/CV.
	4.	Contact Form: A functional contact form for potential employers and collaborators to reach out.
	5.	Responsive Design: Ensured the website is fully responsive and accessible on all devices.

💻 Tech Stack:

	•	HTML5 🌐: Structured the content for semantic clarity.
	•	CSS3 🎨: Styled the website with a focus on aesthetics and user experience.
	•	JavaScript 🚀: Added interactive elements for enhanced functionality.
	•	Optional Additions: Integrated tools and libraries to enhance the site’s features.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply my web development skills in a real-world scenario, and I’m incredibly proud of the outcome.
